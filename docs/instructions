1. High-level product vision

TOVIS is a platform that lets clients browse beauty services like they browse TikTok or shopping apps and book directly with licensed professionals.

Clients scroll through visual feeds: hair, nails, makeup, barbers, mobile massage, etc.

They can save looks, see portfolios, check availability, and book without calling a receptionist or DM’ing strangers.

Pros get:

client retention tools,

aftercare summaries,

rebooking nudges,

and compliance / safety features (especially for mobile services).

Long-term goal: increase the % of beauty school grads who actually stay in the industry by making independent work, suites, and flexible schedules sustainable.

2. User roles

There are three main roles:

Client

Scrolls / browses inspo & services

Finds professionals by:

location

service type

vibe/portfolio

Books appointments

Receives and views aftercare summaries

Rebooks, pays, rates, and purchases recommended products

Professional (Individual)

Can be:

Mobile

In-salon

Suite-based

Or any combo of those

Has a Pro Dashboard:

Today’s bookings

Upcoming schedule

Aftercare summaries they’ve submitted

Who rebooked / who didn’t

Who purchased product

Who still owes payment

Cannot create raw “Services” themselves.
They choose from admin-defined services (e.g., “Full Highlight,” “Classic Fill,” “Gentleman’s Razor Shave”) and create offerings with their pricing, duration, and availability.

Admin (Platform + Salon Owners for white-label)

Platform admin:

Verifies licenses

Manages global catalog of services

Manages complaints, issues, refunds

Tracks system health & metrics

Salon owner (later, white-label mode):

Gets a salon-branded version of the client app

Controls which stylists/services show for that salon’s clients

Sees salon-level metrics & bookings

3. Core MVP features (what a new chat needs to know)
3.1 Authentication & accounts

Email + password auth.

Roles: CLIENT, PRO, ADMIN.

On registration:

If role = CLIENT → create ClientProfile (name, phone, etc.).

If role = PRO → create ProfessionalProfile (business name, location, license info, etc.).

JWT session (cookie) or Supabase auth, depending on final stack. But role-based auth is required.

3.2 Client experience (MVP)

Browse / Discover

Client sees a feed of service offerings:

Card = photos, price, duration, location tag, pro rating.

Filter by:

Location

Category (hair, nails, makeup, barber, massage, etc.)

Mobile / in-salon / suite

Can tap into a pro profile:

Portfolio photos

Services they offer

Reviews

Availability snippet

Booking flow (MVP simple version)

User picks:

One offering (e.g. “Full set Gel X with Soak Off” from Pro X)

Time (exact time for in-salon/suite; time window for mobile)

For mobile:

If client chooses 10:00, booking shows:

Client view: “Pro may arrive between 9:45–10:15”

Pro view: just “10:00”

Booking is created with status = PENDING or ACCEPTED depending on rules.

Client dashboard

Shows upcoming bookings:

Service name

Pro name

Date/time

Status badge: PENDING / ACCEPTED / COMPLETED / CANCELLED

Ability to:

View details

Cancel (within policy, later)

After service is complete:

View aftercare summary

See recommended products & links / purchase

Option to rebook.

3.3 Professional experience (MVP)

Pro dashboard

Today’s appointments (list)

Upcoming bookings

Quick stats:

Rebooking rate

No-show/cancellation count (later)

Access to:

Aftercare summaries

Product recommendations & tracking

Payment status (paid / pending / waiting external)

Start / stop button & aftercare flow

On a booking:

Before starting:

Pro hits Start.

App instructs them:

Take before photos.

Review client’s AI pre-consult (if they did one).

Confirm:

Services agreed

Prices

This “consultation contract” is sent to client app in real time.
Client taps confirm. This protects the pro (“I didn’t know it would cost that much” argument goes away).

While in progress:

Start button flips to Stop / Finished.

On finish:

Take after photos.

Fill out aftercare summary:

What was done

Recommended products (from catalog, not free text for MVP)

When to rebook

Notes (allergies, sensitivities, what worked well)

Option for pro to rebook on the spot and attach next date to summary.

All of that is saved and visible:

In Pro’s “aftercare summaries” tab

In Client’s “past services / aftercare” tab

Location modes

Each pro profile has:

isMobile (true/false)

isInSalon

isSuite

Booking logic:

Desktop / in-salon / suite: fixed times.

Mobile: display arrival window like DoorDash plus optional live tracking later.

3.4 Home-service safety & restrictions (MVP rules)

For mobile services only:

Safety verification

Extra checks for mobile pros before they can take home bookings:

ID / license verification

Possibly background check or manual approval flag on the pro.

Travel kit tracking

Each mobile pro has a “travel kit” checklist of what they usually carry.

Travel kit is mainly for internal / later features (safety & quality), not needed in code for MVP but should exist in data model as TravelKitItem or similar.

Mobile-only categories

Some categories allowed at home:

Example: blowouts, basic haircuts, massage, makeup, simple nail sets, spray tans.

Certain services not allowed as home services for safety/hygiene (e.g. some chemical services, certain invasive treatments).
That’s controlled by flags on Service like allowMobile: boolean.

3.5 White-label salon mode (post-MVP but important to mention)

Goal: make salons feel protected, not poached.

TOVIS has a base app + white-label salon apps.

Base app:

Everyone visible:

Independent pros

Mobile pros

Salon stylists

Clients can:

Find any provider in their area

Book with any salon or individual

White-label salon app:

Branded for a specific salon.

If a client signs up through that salon’s app:

Their view is scoped to:

That salon’s stylists

That salon’s announcements, offers, etc.

They do not see the wider pro marketplace inside that branded experience.

Data rules:

Those clients still technically live in the same underlying database, but:

Salon gets access to their own slice (salon-scoped view).

Platform still maintains global pipes for safety, payments, and compliance.

Stylists in the salon:

Still show up in base app search as normal providers.

But salon-app clients experience is salon-only.

3.6 Group bookings & events (not MVP, but design now)

Two concepts:

Event tab

Shows curated big events:

Example: “Coachella Weekend 1,” “Music Festival X,” “Fashion Week LA”.

Event page:

“Start a group booking for [Event Name]” button.

Shows pros in that event area tagged “Book me for [Event]”.

Group booking flow

One person creates a group (e.g. Stacy makes “Coachella Glam Crew”).

She invites friends (people with accounts).

Inside group:

Group chat style thread.

Members add inspo photos.

Others can react / vote.

Once they decide, they add chosen look(s) to the group “consultation” that pros will see.

Creator:

Chooses services needed for each person and order of service.

Example: Nancy, Stacy, Michelle, Sarah in order.

Sets notification preferences for each participant.

During event day:

Pro sees the order.

Hits Start for Nancy; group sees “Stylist is working on Nancy”.

When Nancy finishes, Stacy gets “You’re up in 5 minutes”.

If someone’s late, they can ask group to swap spots; accepted swap updates order.

Payment:

Each participant can pay for their own services.

One person can pay for others (e.g. bride pays for bridesmaids) by selecting them in checkout.

This doesn’t need to be built first, but new chat should know the shape so we don’t paint ourselves into a corner with the schema.

4. Data model (conceptual, not code)

A new chat should know you already have / want something like:

User

id, email, passwordHash, role

1-to-1 with ClientProfile OR ProfessionalProfile (or neither for ADMIN)

ClientProfile

userId

firstName, lastName, phone

Relations:

bookings

savedServices

savedProfessionals

ProfessionalProfile

userId

businessName

bio

location

licenseNumber

licenseVerified

isMobile, isInSalon, isSuite

Relations:

servicesOffered (via offerings)

bookings

Service (global catalog, admin-managed)

id, name

category

baseDuration

basePrice

Flags like allowMobile

ProfessionalServiceOffering (pro’s specific config for a Service)

id

professionalId

serviceId

price

durationMinutes

Maybe simple isActive flag

Booking

id

clientId

professionalId

serviceId

offeringId

scheduledFor

status (PENDING, ACCEPTED, COMPLETED, CANCELLED)

priceSnapshot

durationMinutesSnapshot

AftercareSummary

id

bookingId

notes

productsRecommended (link to Product table or just snapshot)

rebookedFor (optional next appointment date)

Product (for wholesale & retail)

id

name

brand

salonWholesalePrice

clientRetailPrice

License restrictions (e.g. only certain licenses can buy).

More entities later (Events, Groups, Salon, TravelKitItem, SafetyCheck, etc.), but this is enough for a new assistant to design a sane schema.

5. Tech stack we had settled on

For the new chat, you can say:

Frontend / Backend: Next.js App Router (latest), TypeScript

Database: Postgres via Supabase

ORM: Prisma

Auth: custom email/password with bcrypt + JWT in httpOnly cookies or Supabase auth if we want simpler

UI: Tailwind CSS

Goal: design for millions of users, so:

Migrations via Prisma

No random hacks that break at scale
